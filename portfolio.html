                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a game-changer in automating student database management tasks like data entry and report generation. I specialize in using
                            JavaScript
                            ,
                            XML
                            , and
                            Firebase
                            to create efficient and responsive systems. AI-powered chatbots provide instant support for students and faculty, enhancing overall user experience</p>

                        <p>The concept is to develop target-based augmented reality with the goal of revolutionizing education, providing a highly immersive and comprehensible learning experience for children. The innovation involves introducing an app specifically designed to transform static 2D images from study materials into interactive 3D models. Leveraging

                            for 3D modeling,
                            Unity
                            for cross-platform development, and
                            Vuforia
                            for augmented reality, this initiative aims to elevate the educational landscape by seamlessly merging technology with the learning process.</p>
